Starting to learn Angular 2

Based on TutorialsPoint tutorial found here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/angular2/index.htm


Comments so far:
- Angular 2 reminds me a lot of React. The basic premises seem the same (components, each component starts with import and naming any dependencies, then has a section where it defines the component, then exports it...). React's format seems much easier to switch to from base Javascript, though.
- React had better error reports.
- Tutorialspoint's method of using ng2-pagination is faulty (Third Party Controls)...ng2-pagination is outdated, and now there is ngx-pagination.
-changed Handling Events clicked(event) to onClick(event: any)
